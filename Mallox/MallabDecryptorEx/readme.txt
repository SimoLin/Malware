MallabDecryptorEx
-----------------

1. Brute the decryption key.

To get the decryption key, first run the decryptor on the compromised computer:

MallabDecryptor.exe -type <ENCTYPE> -key <ENCFILE>
ENCFILE - any encrypted file.

If successfully, 'keys.bin' will be created. You don't need to do this stage anymore.


2. Decrypt files.

To decrypt, you will need the decryption key ('keys.bin') in the current directory.

MallabDecryptor.exe [-type <ENCTYPE>] [-all] [-r] [-d] [<PATH1>] [<PATH2>] ... [<PATHN>]

-all - Scan all fixed and removable disks.
-r - Replace existing files.
-d - Delete encrypted files and ransom notes.
<PATH1>, <PATH2>, ... <PATHN> - paths to scan.
